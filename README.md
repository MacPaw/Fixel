* Fixel Font includes extended Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, covering over 40 languages. 
* The font comes in both Text and Display width options, with nine weight options from Thin to Black. 
* The font is a unique combination of geometric and humanist grotesques, with open letterforms, wide width, crisp edges, and low contrast.
* Fixel Font is suitable for a variety of content types and sizes, from headlines and logos to large volumes of text.
* Fixel Font includes alternate symbols. They are more plastic and stand out with higher dynamics and asymmetry.
* Fixel Font preserves the history of the unique Ukrainian graphic culture. Among Fixel’s alternate symbols is the «tryzub,» the seal-trident of Volodymyr the Great and part of the Ukrainian coat of arms. The Fixel’s «tryzub» was developed by the outstanding Ukrainian painter and graphic artist Nil Khasevych in 1949. 
* The font is free and can be used in commercial and other types of projects.
